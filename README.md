# Data Mining Cup 2013 - Basic Transformation

This project contains basic aggregations (min, max, mean) of all user sessions in R.
After that the dataset will be divided in a training and test set.

## Getting Started

1. Install an R environment. I frequently use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).
2. Download dataset "Task" from [Data Mining Cup 2013](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/reviews/dmc-2013/).
